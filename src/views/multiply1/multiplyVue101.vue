            The gospel is not only for you but for all your friends and family.
            God loves them and will use you to pass on what you are learning
            about Jesus so that they can follow Jesus also. As we journey
            together, it will be exciting to see what God will do in the lives
            of those around us.

          Jesus was teaching that he is the good shepherd who lays down his life
          for his sheep (v 11). He also said, &ldquo;I know my sheep and my
          sheep know me,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I have come that they may have life
          and have it to the full.&rdquo; However, many of the Jews don&rsquo;t
          believe him, and doubt His claims. This is where our story begins.
