<h3>The Authority of the Son</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began to persecute him.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>In his defense Jesus said to them, &ldquo;My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Jesus gave them this answer: &ldquo;Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.<sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Very truly I tell you, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself.<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>and come out&mdash;those who have done what is good will rise to live, and those who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.</p>

<h3>Testimonies About Jesus</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is true.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.<sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved.<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to finish&mdash;the very works that I am doing&mdash;testify that the Father has sent me.<sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form,<sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent.<sup class="versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me,<sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>yet you refuse to come to me to have life.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">41&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I do not accept glory from human beings,<sup class="versenum">42&nbsp;</sup>but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.<sup class="versenum">43&nbsp;</sup>I have come in my Father&rsquo;s name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.<sup class="versenum">44&nbsp;</sup>How can you believe since you accept glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">45&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set.<sup class="versenum">46&nbsp;</sup>If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.<sup class="versenum">47&nbsp;</sup>But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?&rdquo;</p>
