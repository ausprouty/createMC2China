<p class="up">The movement is growing. Crowds from all over came to hear Jesus and be healed. The healing of the man with leprosy had brought Pharisees and teachers of the Law from every village in Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem. The leaders had gathered to find out more about this man who had healed a leper. On this occasion, Jesus was healing many through the power of the Spirit. Four friends boldly forced their way to the front of the crowd to bring their paralyzed friend to Jesus. He used the situation as his fifth outreach, to witness to the religious leaders about who He really is. The leaders understood the implications of what Jesus said and did. By forgiving the man&rsquo;s sins, Jesus shows Himself equal with God. Everyone who saw the healing gave glory to the Father.</p>
