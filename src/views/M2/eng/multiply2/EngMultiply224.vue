<h3>The Healing at the Pool</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Here a great number of disabled people used to lie&mdash;the blind, the lame, the paralyzed.<sup class="versenum">[4]&nbsp;</sup><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, &ldquo;Do you want to get well?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; the invalid replied, &ldquo;I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked.</p>

<p>The day on which this took place was a Sabbath,<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, &ldquo;It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>But he replied, &ldquo;The man who made me well said to me, &lsquo;Pick up your mat and walk.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>So they asked him, &ldquo;Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, &ldquo;See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well.</p>

<h3>The Authority of the Son</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began to persecute him.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>In his defense Jesus said to them, &ldquo;My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="up">Jesus makes another long trip down to Jerusalem for a feast. His last trip to Jerusalem for a feast caused a big commotion. The same thing happened again. This time the Father led Jesus to a pool just outside one of the city gates, called the Sheep Gate. There were many sick people lying around the pool. Jesus only healed the one the Father prompted him to. Because this was done on a Sabbath (day of rest), the religious leaders were very upset and persecuted Jesus. Jesus used the opportunity to reveal His unique relationship with the Father. Jesus was telling the truth that he is God. The Jews clearly understood that Jesus was claiming to be equal to God and from this time on, they seek a way to kill Him.</p>
