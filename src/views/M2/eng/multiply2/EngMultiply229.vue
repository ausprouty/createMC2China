<p class="up">Jesus finished teaching his disciples. Travelling back to Capernaum he meets a Roman Centurion, a military officer in charge of 100 men. This Roman military leader showed unusual love and compassion for his sick slave by asking for Jesus&rsquo; help. The Centurion&rsquo;s job was to maintain order, enforce the laws, and make sure the taxes were being collected. But God used the Centurion to instruct the leaders of the movement. They learned:</p>

<ol>
	<li class="up">A leader loves those they are leading;</li>
	<li class="up">A leader leads with humility, realizing that he is not worthy of honor;</li>
	<li class="up">A leader leads by faith, not trusting in what he can see but in the invisible God</li>
	<li class="up">A leader never forgets that he is under authority and that he will give an account for the people placed under his care. Jesus was amazed to meet a man like this.</li>
