<p class="year">Period 5: Leadership Multiplication:&nbsp;around Late 28 AD &ndash; Spring 30 AD</p>

<p><br />
Multiplication of the movement: prayerfully selecting and developing new leaders, sending proven multipliers to continue as movement building leaders</p>

<ul>
	<li class="nobreak-final-final">This period lasts for about 15 months and begins with the appointing of the Twelve as Apostles. The Apostles become &ldquo;leaders in training&rdquo; within the larger group of ministry workers. There is still a larger group of followers and seekers (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop1')"> Luke 6:12-19</span>).&nbsp;

	<div class="popup invisible" id="pop1"><!-- begin bible -->

	<h3>The Twelve Apostles</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles:<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot,<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon,<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by impure spirits were cured,<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	<!-- end bible --></div>
	&nbsp;The Twelve are the fruit of Jesus&rsquo; deliberate selection, appointment, training and personal investment. This is further demonstrated after Pentecost through the Kingdom expansion captured in the Book of Acts.</li>
	<li class="nobreak-final-final">Later in this period, Jesus sent out 72&nbsp;others (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop2')"> Luke 10:1</span>) .
	<div class="popup invisible" id="pop2"><!-- begin bible -->
	<div>
	<div>
	<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go.</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	<!-- end bible --></div>
	&nbsp;Even though they were not given the same formal leadership status within the Gospel record as the Twelve, they too were commissioned as &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; (i.e. sent ones). We see the built-in multiplication of leaders as this new group was commanded to pray for the next generation of workers that would be raised up through their work (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop3')"> Luke 10:2</span>).&nbsp;

	<div class="popup invisible" id="pop3"><!-- begin bible -->
	<div>
	<div>
	<p><sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>He told them, &ldquo;The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	<!-- end bible --></div>
	&nbsp;No doubt many of these un-named 72&nbsp;missionaries were present in the early church, among the 120 in the upper room and included among the 500 people Jesus appeared to after His resurrection (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop4')"> 1 Corinthians 15:6</span>).&nbsp;

	<div class="popup invisible" id="pop4"><!-- begin bible -->
	<div>
	<div>
	<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep.</p>
