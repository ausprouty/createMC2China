<h3>Jesus Teaches Nicodemus</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>He came to Jesus at night and said, &ldquo;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Jesus replied, &ldquo;Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;How can someone be born when they are old?&rdquo; Nicodemus asked. &ldquo;Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother&rsquo;s womb to be born!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered, &ldquo;Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>You should not be surprised at my saying, &lsquo;You must be born again.&rsquo;<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;How can this be?&rdquo; Nicodemus asked.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;You are Israel&rsquo;s teacher,&rdquo; said Jesus, &ldquo;and do you not understand these things?<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven&mdash;the Son of Man.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God&rsquo;s one and only Son.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.</p>

<p class="up">When Jesus drove out the money changers at the temple, He caught the attention of everyone. A high-ranking religious leader named Nicodemus came to investigate Jesus. Jesus challenges him to take his eyes off himself and what seems impossible and challenges him to open his eyes of faith. Jesus shares that what Nicodemus thinks is impossible becomes possible. Even though you cannot see the wind, you can see its effects. Jesus says it is the same for those who have been born in the Spirit. God loved us so much that He provided a way for us to be reborn, to have new life in Him.</p>
