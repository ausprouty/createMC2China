<p class="up">Six days after Peter&rsquo;s confession about who Jesus is, Jesus begins teaching about suffering as part of expanding the Kingdom. Jesus selects three of the twelve leaders and sets them apart. Peter, James, and John come even closer so that Jesus may reveal more of who He is and give them special instruction as the leaders of the leaders. He leaves the nine and takes the three up to the top of a mountain and allows them to see His full glory revealed. On the mountain top they hear the voice of the Father affirming Jesus, His Son. Even though Moses and Elijah were heroes for the Jewish people, the Father sets Jesus higher than all others and tells the three to &ldquo;listen to Him.&rdquo;</p>
