<h3>Jesus Calls Levi and Eats With Sinners</h3>

<h3>Jesus Questioned About Fasting</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>He told them this parable: &ldquo;No one tears a piece out of a new garment to patch an old one.

<p class="up">Matthew was also a Jew known as Levi, son of Alphaeus. He was powerful, commissioned, trusted, wealthy and protected by Rome to collect taxes from the people of Israel. But as a tax collector, he was a traitor and hated by his own people. He lived in Capernaum. He had been watching Jesus and had heard about all He was doing. Maybe He had already been considering giving up everything to follow Jesus. Clearly the Father had been preparing his heart because he responded to Jesus&rsquo; call to follow Him. Immediately, Matthew introduced Jesus to his tax collector friends. In this sixth outreach, Jesus risked His reputation by spending time with this group of hated tax collectors. Jesus demonstrated His love as He modeled extending grace to hated people. Jesus loved being known as a friend of sinners.</p>
