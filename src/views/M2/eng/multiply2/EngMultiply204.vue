<h3>The Return to Nazareth</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>and said, &ldquo;Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child&rsquo;s life are dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.<sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.</p>
