<h1>Introduction</h1>
<div id="showVideoOptions"></div>
  <p>Jesus is our model for life and ministry. Because He is our model, it is important to know His character, His priorities, and His process for building a disciple-making movement. This movement multiplies others for fulfilling the Great Commission.</p>

<ul>
	<li class="nobreak-final-final">Christmas is the time we celebrate the mystery of The Word (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop1')"> John 1:1</span>).&nbsp;

	<div>
	<p><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p>

	born as a baby boy, Jesus of Nazareth. He came from eternity and entered into time and space. He entered a family, a culture, a village, a tribe and lived life one day at a time in first century Roman controlled Israel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Though fully God, He chose to live His life as fully man, in total surrendered obedience to His heavenly Father. What He achieved in His life and ministry, He achieved as the man from Nazareth, the Son of Man, through the power and presence of the Holy Spirit in fulfilment of the Father&rsquo;s will. Though He had every right to operate out of his divinity, He chose to only live out of His perfect sinless humanity to be our example of how to fully glorify God in our life and ministry.</p>

<ul>
	<li class="nobreak-final-final">Jesus was and will always be fully God. Even though He had all the authority, power and resources of heaven at his command, He never used it. Instead He chose to &ldquo;become like his brothers in every way&rdquo; (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop3')"> Hebrews 2:17</span>)&nbsp;

	<div class="popup invisible" id="pop3"><!-- begin bible -->

	<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>For this reason he had to be made like them, fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people.</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	<!-- end bible --></div>
	&nbsp;but without sin. Because of this, the book of Hebrews encourages us, &ldquo;Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess.&rdquo; (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop4')"> Hebrews 3:1</span>).&nbsp;

	</div>
	</div>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The four Gospel writers record a summary of His life and teachings. By studying their written witness, we can learn about the development of His movement. In His humanity, even Jesus was subject to time and space and lived in the sequence of hours, days, weeks, years. He initiated and developed His movement in time. Therefore, Jesus&rsquo; case study is very instructive for leaders. We gain insight into how His life and movement unfolded over time by reconstructing a chronological sequence from the evidence provided by the Gospels.</p>

<ul>
	<li class="nobreak-final-final">Luke tells us that he sought to provide a well investigated and &ldquo;orderly account&rdquo; of Jesus life (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop5')"> Luke 1:1-4</span>).&nbsp;

	</div>
	</div>
	<!-- end bible --></div>
	&nbsp;The other writers were not concerned with order of events but arranged their accounts around themes. For example, John, the last of the four to write his gospel, recorded a lot of new material filling in some of the gaps in time especially the first year and a half (John 1-4) and the last few weeks (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop6')"> John 12-21</span>)

	<h3>Jesus Anointed at Bethany</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>Here a dinner was given in Jesus&rsquo; honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus&rsquo; feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected,<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year&rsquo;s wages.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Leave her alone,&rdquo; Jesus replied. &ldquo;It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well,<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and believing in him.</p>

	<h3>Jesus Comes to Jerusalem as King</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>The next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting,</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Hosanna!&rdquo;</p>
	</div>

	<p>&ldquo;Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!&rdquo;</p>
	</div>

	<p>&ldquo;Blessed is the king of Israel!&rdquo;</p>
	</div>

	<p><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, as it is written:</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Do not be afraid, Daughter Zion;<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see, your king is coming,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seated on a donkey&rsquo;s colt.&rdquo;</p>
	</div>

	<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that these things had been done to him.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word.<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>Many people, because they had heard that he had performed this sign, went out to meet him.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>So the Pharisees said to one another, &ldquo;See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!&rdquo;</p>

	<h3>Jesus Predicts His Death</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the festival.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we would like to see Jesus.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Jesus replied, &ldquo;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? &lsquo;Father, save me from this hour&rsquo;? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>Father, glorify your name!&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Then a voice came from heaven, &ldquo;I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said, &ldquo;This voice was for your benefit, not mine.<sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>The crowd spoke up, &ldquo;We have heard from the Law that the Messiah will remain forever, so how can you say, &lsquo;The Son of Man must be lifted up&rsquo;? Who is this &lsquo;Son of Man&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus told them, &ldquo;You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going.<sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may become children of light.&rdquo; When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.</p>

	<h3>Belief and Unbelief Among the Jews</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>Even after Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him.<sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet:</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Lord, who has believed our message<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?&rdquo;</p>
	</div>

	<p><sup class="versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere:</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;He has blinded their eyes<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hardened their hearts,<br />
	so they can neither see with their eyes,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor understand with their hearts,<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor turn&mdash;and I would heal them.&rdquo;</p>
	</div>

	<p><sup class="versenum">41&nbsp;</sup>Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus&rsquo; glory and spoke about him.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">42&nbsp;</sup>Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue;<sup class="versenum">43&nbsp;</sup>for they loved human praise more than praise from God.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">44&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus cried out, &ldquo;Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me.<sup class="versenum">45&nbsp;</sup>The one who looks at me is seeing the one who sent me.<sup class="versenum">46&nbsp;</sup>I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">47&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.<sup class="versenum">48&nbsp;</sup>There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day.<sup class="versenum">49&nbsp;</sup>For I did not speak on my own, but the Father who sent me commanded me to say all that I have spoken.<sup class="versenum">50&nbsp;</sup>I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say.&rdquo;</p>

	<h3>Jesus Washes His Disciples&rsquo; Feet</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>It was just before the Passover Festival. Jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already prompted Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God;<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples&rsquo; feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, &ldquo;Lord, are you going to wash my feet?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Jesus replied, &ldquo;You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;you shall never wash my feet.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Jesus answered, &ldquo;Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Then, Lord,&rdquo; Simon Peter replied, &ldquo;not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered, &ldquo;Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. &ldquo;Do you understand what I have done for you?&rdquo; he asked them.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;You call me &lsquo;Teacher&rsquo; and &lsquo;Lord,&rsquo; and rightly so, for that is what I am.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another&rsquo;s feet.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.</p>

	<h3>Jesus Predicts His Betrayal</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill this passage of Scripture: &lsquo;He who shared my bread has turned against me.&rsquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that I am who I am.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Very truly I tell you, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>After he had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, &ldquo;Very truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, &ldquo;Ask him which one he means.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, &ldquo;Lord, who is it?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered, &ldquo;It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.&rdquo; Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.</p>

	<p>So Jesus told him, &ldquo;What you are about to do, do quickly.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>But no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him.<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the festival, or to give something to the poor.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.</p>

	<h3>Jesus Predicts Peter&rsquo;s Denial</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>When he was gone, Jesus said, &ldquo;Now the Son of Man is glorified and God is glorified in him.<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>Simon Peter asked him, &ldquo;Lord, where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Jesus replied, &ldquo;Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>Peter asked, &ldquo;Lord, why can&rsquo;t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus answered, &ldquo;Will you really lay down your life for me? Very truly I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times!</p>

	<h3>Jesus Comforts His Disciples</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>&ldquo;Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>My Father&rsquo;s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>You know the way to the place where I am going.&rdquo;</p>

	<h3>Jesus the Way to the Father</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>Thomas said to him, &ldquo;Lord, we don&rsquo;t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered, &ldquo;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Philip said, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, &lsquo;Show us the Father&rsquo;?<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Don&rsquo;t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.</p>

	<h3>Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;If you love me, keep my commands.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever&mdash;<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, &ldquo;But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Jesus replied, &ldquo;Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;All this I have spoken while still with you.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;You heard me say, &lsquo;I am going away and I am coming back to you.&rsquo; If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>I will not say much more to you, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold over me,<sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>but he comes so that the world may learn that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Come now; let us leave.</p>

	<h3>The Vine and the Branches</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>&ldquo;I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>This is to my Father&rsquo;s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father&rsquo;s commands and remain in his love.<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one&rsquo;s life for one&rsquo;s friends.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>You are my friends if you do what I command.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master&rsquo;s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit&mdash;fruit that will last&mdash;and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>This is my command: Love each other.</p>

	<h3>The World Hates the Disciples</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Remember what I told you: &lsquo;A servant is not greater than his master.&rsquo; If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the one who sent me.<sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Whoever hates me hates my Father as well.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>If I had not done among them the works no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. As it is, they have seen, and yet they have hated both me and my Father.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: &lsquo;They hated me without reason.&rsquo;</p>

	<h3>The Work of the Holy Spirit</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father&mdash;the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father&mdash;he will testify about me.<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>And you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>&ldquo;All this I have told you so that you will not fall away.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>I have told you this, so that when their time comes you will remember that I warned you about them. I did not tell you this from the beginning because I was with you,<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>but now I am going to him who sent me. None of you asks me, &lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo;<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Rather, you are filled with grief because I have said these things.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>But very truly I tell you, it is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment:<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>about sin, because people do not believe in me;<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>about righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer;<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>and about judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>He will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what he will make known to you.&rdquo;</p>

	<h3>The Disciples&rsquo; Grief Will Turn to Joy</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Jesus went on to say, &ldquo;In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>At this, some of his disciples said to one another, &ldquo;What does he mean by saying, &lsquo;In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Because I am going to the Father&rsquo;?&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>They kept asking, &ldquo;What does he mean by &lsquo;a little while&rsquo;? We don&rsquo;t understand what he is saying.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, &ldquo;Are you asking one another what I meant when I said, &lsquo;In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me&rsquo;?<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Very truly I tell you, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world.<sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>In that day you will no longer ask me anything. Very truly I tell you, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf.<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus&rsquo; disciples said, &ldquo;Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Do you now believe?&rdquo; Jesus replied.<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;A time is coming and in fact has come when you will be scattered, each to your own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.&rdquo;</p>

	<h3>Jesus Prays to Be Glorified</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed:</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>I have brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Jesus Prays for His Disciples</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them.<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name, the name you gave me, so that they may be one as we are one.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Jesus Prays for All Believers</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message,<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.<sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one&mdash;<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>I in them and you in me&mdash;so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them.&rdquo;</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Jesus Arrested</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>When he had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was a garden, and he and his disciples went into it.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>So Judas came to the garden, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and the Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, &ldquo;Who is it you want?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth,&rdquo; they replied.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;I am he,&rdquo; Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.)<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus said, &ldquo;I am he,&rdquo; they drew back and fell to the ground.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Again he asked them, &ldquo;Who is it you want?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth,&rdquo; they said.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered, &ldquo;I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, then let these men go.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: &ldquo;I have not lost one of those you gave me.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest&rsquo;s servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant&rsquo;s name was Malchus.)</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Jesus commanded Peter, &ldquo;Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound him<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be good if one man died for the people.</p>

	<h3>Peter&rsquo;s First Denial</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest&rsquo;s courtyard,<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the servant girl on duty there and brought Peter in.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t one of this man&rsquo;s disciples too, are you?&rdquo; she asked Peter.</p>

	<p>He replied, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>It was cold, and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.</p>

	<h3>The High Priest Questions Jesus</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I have spoken openly to the world,&rdquo; Jesus replied. &ldquo;I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby slapped him in the face. &ldquo;Is this the way you answer the high priest?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;If I said something wrong,&rdquo; Jesus replied, &ldquo;testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</p>

	<h3>Peter&rsquo;s Second and Third Denials</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Meanwhile, Simon Peter was still standing there warming himself. So they asked him, &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t one of his disciples too, are you?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>He denied it, saying, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>One of the high priest&rsquo;s servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I see you with him in the garden?&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow.</p>

	<h3>Jesus Before Pilate</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness they did not enter the palace, because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>So Pilate came out to them and asked, &ldquo;What charges are you bringing against this man?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;If he were not a criminal,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;we would not have handed him over to you.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>Pilate said, &ldquo;Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;But we have no right to execute anyone,&rdquo; they objected.<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>This took place to fulfill what Jesus had said about the kind of death he was going to die.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, &ldquo;Are you the king of the Jews?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Is that your own idea,&rdquo; Jesus asked, &ldquo;or did others talk to you about me?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Am I a Jew?&rdquo; Pilate replied. &ldquo;Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me. What is it you have done?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said, &ldquo;My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;You are a king, then!&rdquo; said Pilate.</p>

	<p>Jesus answered, &ldquo;You say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo; retorted Pilate. With this he went out again to the Jews gathered there and said, &ldquo;I find no basis for a charge against him.<sup class="versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release &lsquo;the king of the Jews&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>They shouted back, &ldquo;No, not him! Give us Barabbas!&rdquo; Now Barabbas had taken part in an uprising.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>and went up to him again and again, saying, &ldquo;Hail, king of the Jews!&rdquo; And they slapped him in the face.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews gathered there, &ldquo;Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Here is the man!&rdquo;</p>

	<h3>Jesus Washes His Disciples&rsquo; Feet</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>It was just before the Passover Festival. Jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already prompted Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God;<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples&rsquo; feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, &ldquo;Lord, are you going to wash my feet?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Jesus replied, &ldquo;You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;you shall never wash my feet.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Jesus answered, &ldquo;Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Then, Lord,&rdquo; Simon Peter replied, &ldquo;not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered, &ldquo;Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. &ldquo;Do you understand what I have done for you?&rdquo; he asked them.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;You call me &lsquo;Teacher&rsquo; and &lsquo;Lord,&rsquo; and rightly so, for that is what I am.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another&rsquo;s feet.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.</p>

	<h3>Jesus Predicts His Betrayal</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill this passage of Scripture: &lsquo;He who shared my bread has turned against me.&rsquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that I am who I am.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Very truly I tell you, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>After he had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, &ldquo;Very truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, &ldquo;Ask him which one he means.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, &ldquo;Lord, who is it?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered, &ldquo;It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.&rdquo; Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.</p>

	<p>So Jesus told him, &ldquo;What you are about to do, do quickly.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>But no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him.<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the festival, or to give something to the poor.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.</p>

	<h3>Jesus Predicts Peter&rsquo;s Denial</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>When he was gone, Jesus said, &ldquo;Now the Son of Man is glorified and God is glorified in him.<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>Simon Peter asked him, &ldquo;Lord, where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Jesus replied, &ldquo;Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>Peter asked, &ldquo;Lord, why can&rsquo;t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus answered, &ldquo;Will you really lay down your life for me? Very truly I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times!</p>

	<h3>Jesus Comforts His Disciples</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>&ldquo;Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>My Father&rsquo;s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>You know the way to the place where I am going.&rdquo;</p>

	<h3>Jesus the Way to the Father</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>Thomas said to him, &ldquo;Lord, we don&rsquo;t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered, &ldquo;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Philip said, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, &lsquo;Show us the Father&rsquo;?<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Don&rsquo;t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.</p>

	<h3>Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;If you love me, keep my commands.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever&mdash;<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, &ldquo;But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Jesus replied, &ldquo;Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;All this I have spoken while still with you.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;You heard me say, &lsquo;I am going away and I am coming back to you.&rsquo; If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>I will not say much more to you, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold over me,<sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>but he comes so that the world may learn that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Come now; let us leave.</p>

	<h3>The Vine and the Branches</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>&ldquo;I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>This is to my Father&rsquo;s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father&rsquo;s commands and remain in his love.<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one&rsquo;s life for one&rsquo;s friends.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>You are my friends if you do what I command.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master&rsquo;s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit&mdash;fruit that will last&mdash;and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>This is my command: Love each other.</p>

	<h3>The World Hates the Disciples</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Remember what I told you: &lsquo;A servant is not greater than his master.&rsquo; If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the one who sent me.<sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Whoever hates me hates my Father as well.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>If I had not done among them the works no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. As it is, they have seen, and yet they have hated both me and my Father.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: &lsquo;They hated me without reason.&rsquo;</p>

	<h3>The Work of the Holy Spirit</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father&mdash;the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father&mdash;he will testify about me.<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>And you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>&ldquo;All this I have told you so that you will not fall away.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>I have told you this, so that when their time comes you will remember that I warned you about them. I did not tell you this from the beginning because I was with you,<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>but now I am going to him who sent me. None of you asks me, &lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo;<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Rather, you are filled with grief because I have said these things.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>But very truly I tell you, it is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment:<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>about sin, because people do not believe in me;<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>about righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer;<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>and about judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>He will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what he will make known to you.&rdquo;</p>

	<h3>The Disciples&rsquo; Grief Will Turn to Joy</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Jesus went on to say, &ldquo;In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>At this, some of his disciples said to one another, &ldquo;What does he mean by saying, &lsquo;In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Because I am going to the Father&rsquo;?&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>They kept asking, &ldquo;What does he mean by &lsquo;a little while&rsquo;? We don&rsquo;t understand what he is saying.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, &ldquo;Are you asking one another what I meant when I said, &lsquo;In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me&rsquo;?<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Very truly I tell you, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world.<sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>In that day you will no longer ask me anything. Very truly I tell you, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf.<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus&rsquo; disciples said, &ldquo;Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Do you now believe?&rdquo; Jesus replied.<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;A time is coming and in fact has come when you will be scattered, each to your own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.&rdquo;</p>

	<h3>Jesus Prays to Be Glorified</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed:</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>I have brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Jesus Prays for His Disciples</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them.<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name, the name you gave me, so that they may be one as we are one.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Jesus Prays for All Believers</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message,<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.<sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one&mdash;<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>I in them and you in me&mdash;so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them.&rdquo;</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Jesus Arrested</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>When he had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was a garden, and he and his disciples went into it.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>So Judas came to the garden, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and the Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, &ldquo;Who is it you want?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth,&rdquo; they replied.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;I am he,&rdquo; Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.)<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus said, &ldquo;I am he,&rdquo; they drew back and fell to the ground.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Again he asked them, &ldquo;Who is it you want?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth,&rdquo; they said.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered, &ldquo;I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, then let these men go.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: &ldquo;I have not lost one of those you gave me.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest&rsquo;s servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant&rsquo;s name was Malchus.)</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Jesus commanded Peter, &ldquo;Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound him<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be good if one man died for the people.</p>

	<h3>Peter&rsquo;s First Denial</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest&rsquo;s courtyard,<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the servant girl on duty there and brought Peter in.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t one of this man&rsquo;s disciples too, are you?&rdquo; she asked Peter.</p>

	<p>He replied, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>It was cold, and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.</p>

	<h3>The High Priest Questions Jesus</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I have spoken openly to the world,&rdquo; Jesus replied. &ldquo;I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby slapped him in the face. &ldquo;Is this the way you answer the high priest?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;If I said something wrong,&rdquo; Jesus replied, &ldquo;testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</p>

	<h3>Peter&rsquo;s Second and Third Denials</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Meanwhile, Simon Peter was still standing there warming himself. So they asked him, &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t one of his disciples too, are you?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>He denied it, saying, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>One of the high priest&rsquo;s servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I see you with him in the garden?&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow.</p>

	<h3>Jesus Before Pilate</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness they did not enter the palace, because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>So Pilate came out to them and asked, &ldquo;What charges are you bringing against this man?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;If he were not a criminal,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;we would not have handed him over to you.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>Pilate said, &ldquo;Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;But we have no right to execute anyone,&rdquo; they objected.<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>This took place to fulfill what Jesus had said about the kind of death he was going to die.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, &ldquo;Are you the king of the Jews?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Is that your own idea,&rdquo; Jesus asked, &ldquo;or did others talk to you about me?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Am I a Jew?&rdquo; Pilate replied. &ldquo;Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me. What is it you have done?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said, &ldquo;My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;You are a king, then!&rdquo; said Pilate.</p>

	<p>Jesus answered, &ldquo;You say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo; retorted Pilate. With this he went out again to the Jews gathered there and said, &ldquo;I find no basis for a charge against him.<sup class="versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release &lsquo;the king of the Jews&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>They shouted back, &ldquo;No, not him! Give us Barabbas!&rdquo; Now Barabbas had taken part in an uprising.</p>

	<h3>Jesus Sentenced to Be Crucified</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>and went up to him again and again, saying, &ldquo;Hail, king of the Jews!&rdquo; And they slapped him in the face.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews gathered there, &ldquo;Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Here is the man!&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, &ldquo;Crucify! Crucify!&rdquo;</p>

	<p>But Pilate answered, &ldquo;You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>The Jewish leaders insisted, &ldquo;We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid,<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>and he went back inside the palace. &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo; he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Do you refuse to speak to me?&rdquo; Pilate said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered, &ldquo;You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders kept shouting, &ldquo;If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge&rsquo;s seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha).<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Here is your king,&rdquo; Pilate said to the Jews.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>But they shouted, &ldquo;Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Shall I crucify your king?&rdquo; Pilate asked.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;We have no king but Caesar,&rdquo; the chief priests answered.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified.</p>

	<h3>The Crucifixion of Jesus</h3>

	<p>So the soldiers took charge of Jesus.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha).<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>There they crucified him, and with him two others&mdash;one on each side and Jesus in the middle.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: <span class="small-caps">jesus of nazareth, <span class="small-caps">the king of the jews.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, &ldquo;Do not write &lsquo;The King of the Jews,&rsquo; but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>Pilate answered, &ldquo;What I have written, I have written.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not tear it,&rdquo; they said to one another. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s decide by lot who will get it.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that said,</p>

	<p>&ldquo;They divided my clothes among them<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cast lots for my garment.&rdquo;</p>
	</div>

	<p>So this is what the soldiers did.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother&rsquo;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, &ldquo;Woman, here is your son,&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>and to the disciple, &ldquo;Here is your mother.&rdquo; From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.</p>

	<h3>The Death of Jesus</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>Later, knowing that everything had now been finished, and so that Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, &ldquo;I am thirsty.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus&rsquo; lips.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>When he had received the drink, Jesus said, &ldquo;It is finished.&rdquo; With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.<sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus&rsquo; side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.<sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: &ldquo;Not one of his bones will be broken,&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>and, as another scripture says, &ldquo;They will look on the one they have pierced.&rdquo;</p>

	<h3>The Burial of Jesus</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jewish leaders. With Pilate&rsquo;s permission, he came and took the body away.<sup class="versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds.<sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>Taking Jesus&rsquo; body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.<sup class="versenum">41&nbsp;</sup>At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.<sup class="versenum">42&nbsp;</sup>Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.</p>

	<h3>The Empty Tomb</h3>

	<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, &ldquo;They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don&rsquo;t know where they have put him!&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in.<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Then Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there,<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus&rsquo; head. The cloth was still lying in its place, separate from the linen.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>(They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.)<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Then the disciples went back to where they were staying.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Now Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus&rsquo; body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>They asked her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you crying?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;They have taken my Lord away,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know where they have put him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Gospel of Luke gives us some date markers so that we can locate Jesus in a historical context.</p>

	&nbsp;This is important because it helps us learn more about when and how long Jesus did his ministry. We can begin to see steps he took to lay a foundation for disciple-making, develop his followers into disciple-makers and over time equip proven disciple-makers to become multiplying movement leaders.</li>
