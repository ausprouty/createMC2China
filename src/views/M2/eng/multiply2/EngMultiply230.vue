<h3>Jesus and John the Baptist</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>John&rsquo;s disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them,<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>he sent them to the Lord to ask, &ldquo;Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>When the men came to Jesus, they said, &ldquo;John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, &lsquo;Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.<sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>So he replied to the messengers, &ldquo;Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>After John&rsquo;s messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: &ldquo;What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>This is the one about whom it is written:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will send my messenger ahead of you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who will prepare your way before you.&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>(All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus&rsquo; words, acknowledged that God&rsquo;s way was right, because they had been baptized by John.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God&rsquo;s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.)</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>Jesus went on to say, &ldquo;To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We played the pipe for you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you did not dance;<br />
we sang a dirge,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you did not cry.&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, &lsquo;He has a demon.&rsquo;<sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, &lsquo;Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.&rsquo;<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>But wisdom is proved right by all her children.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="up">Jesus was often misunderstood. John the Baptist had been sitting in prison and was struggling with doubts about Jesus being the one to bring in the Kingdom of God. So John sent a few of his remaining disciples to ask Jesus about it. Jesus sends the men back with an Old Testament scripture from Isaiah (which is the same one He used in Nazareth) to let John know He was doing the works of the Messiah. Jesus then endorses the leadership of John to His disciples. He contrasted this with the evil things people said about John and about Himself. Even after watching Jesus for over two years, religious leaders accused Jesus of being demon possessed, a glutton and a drunkard. We learn that being misunderstood is part of leadership.</p>
