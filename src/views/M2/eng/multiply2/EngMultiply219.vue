<h3>Jesus Heals Many</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>Simon&rsquo;s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her.<sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up.

<p><sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>The whole town gathered at the door,<sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>and Jesus healed many who had various diseases.

<p class="up">Jesus&rsquo; second outreach is at Peter&rsquo;s house. This is a home outreach that began in the evening after sunset. People from all over the region came to see the man who had cast out a demon in the synagogue. This was a spontaneous event that lasted several hours into the night. After a long night of ministry, Jesus gets up early and slips out of the house to be alone with the Father. He modeled the priority of being alone with the Father, to hear His voice, to find out the next steps in life and ministry, and to fellowship with Him. Even though everyone wanted Jesus to stay and have more successful ministry, He left out of obedience to the Father and the scope of His mission.</p>
