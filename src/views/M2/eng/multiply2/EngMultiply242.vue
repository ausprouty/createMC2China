<h3>Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>His disciples asked him, &ldquo;Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Neither this man nor his parents sinned,&rdquo; said Jesus, &ldquo;but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>As long as it is day, we must do the works of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>After saying this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man&rsquo;s eyes.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; he told him, &ldquo;wash in the Pool of Siloam&rdquo; (this word means &ldquo;Sent&rdquo;). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this the same man who used to sit and beg?&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Some claimed that he was.</p>

<p>Others said, &ldquo;No, he only looks like him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he himself insisted, &ldquo;I am the man.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;How then were your eyes opened?&rdquo; they asked.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>He replied, &ldquo;The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Where is this man?&rdquo; they asked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<h3>The Pharisees Investigate the Healing</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man&rsquo;s eyes was a Sabbath.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. &ldquo;He put mud on my eyes,&rdquo; the man replied, &ldquo;and I washed, and now I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Some of the Pharisees said, &ldquo;This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But others asked, &ldquo;How can a sinner perform such signs?&rdquo; So they were divided.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Then they turned again to the blind man, &ldquo;What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man replied, &ldquo;He is a prophet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>They still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man&rsquo;s parents.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Is this your son?&rdquo; they asked. &ldquo;Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;We know he is our son,&rdquo; the parents answered, &ldquo;and we know he was born blind.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don&rsquo;t know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who already had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>That was why his parents said, &ldquo;He is of age; ask him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. &ldquo;Give glory to God by telling the truth,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;We know this man is a sinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>He replied, &ldquo;Whether he is a sinner or not, I don&rsquo;t know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>Then they asked him, &ldquo;What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>He answered, &ldquo;I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>Then they hurled insults at him and said, &ldquo;You are this fellow&rsquo;s disciple! We are disciples of Moses!<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don&rsquo;t even know where he comes from.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>The man answered, &ldquo;Now that is remarkable! You don&rsquo;t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.<sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly person who does his will.<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>To this they replied, &ldquo;You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!&rdquo; And they threw him out.</p>

<h3>Spiritual Blindness</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, &ldquo;Do you believe in the Son of Man?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Who is he, sir?&rdquo; the man asked. &ldquo;Tell me so that I may believe in him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said, &ldquo;You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>Then the man said, &ldquo;Lord, I believe,&rdquo; and he worshiped him.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said, &ldquo;For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, &ldquo;What? Are we blind too?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">41&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said, &ldquo;If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.</p>

<p class="up">Jesus attends another feast, the Feast of Dedication (or Feast of Lights). This was to remember a time when God did a miracle to provide light in the lamps when there was not enough oil for them to keep burning. At the feast, Jesus meets a man blind from birth. Most people believed that if someone was suffering it was because they or someone close to them had sinned. Jesus shocks those around Him by saying that this man was born blind not because of sin but so that God&rsquo;s glory would be displayed in His life. He taught an amazing principle: God can allow suffering so that He might be glorified. It is important to remember that God is the center of life. He gets glory by answering people when they call out to Him in need. A lesson for us is to be careful about judging why someone is suffering. The suffering may not be the result of anything they have done, but because of the work God will do in their lives.</p>
