<h3>Jesus Walks on the Water</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone,<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a ghost,&rdquo; they said, and cried out in fear.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>But Jesus immediately said to them: &ldquo;Take courage! It is I. Don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Lord, if it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; Peter replied, &ldquo;tell me to come to you on the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, &ldquo;Lord, save me!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. &ldquo;You of little faith,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why did you doubt?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, &ldquo;Truly you are the Son of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="up">Jesus made His disciples go out in the boat to cross the water, while He sought time alone with the Father. Amazingly, He intentionally sent them into a storm and watched his leaders struggle for a while. Then Jesus joined the disciples by walking on the water to where they were. Being tired and afraid, they started screaming &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a ghost!&rdquo; As Jesus tries to comfort them, Peter shows his bold faith by wanting to go be with Jesus out on the water. Peter did well until he took his eyes off Jesus. As Peter cries out to be saved, Jesus immediately rescues him. The twelve apostles knew they were in the presence of the Son of God and responded by worshipping Him.</p>
