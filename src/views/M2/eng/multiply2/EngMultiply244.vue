<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, saying: &ldquo;Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after your body has been killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him.<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don&rsquo;t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I tell you, whoever publicly acknowledges me before others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>But whoever disowns me before others will be disowned before the angels of God.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.</p>

	<li class="nobreak-final-final">Over the last six months, Jesus has been drawing a sharp contrast between the type of leadership He expects and the type of leadership His disciples have had as a model growing up. He points out how the leaders of Israel are leading. He says this is not how leadership should be in the Kingdom. He uses the illustration of yeast that spreads through dough to make bread as an example of what to avoid. There are two types, the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of the Sadducees. The Pharisees taught one thing, but did another. The Pharisees were hypocrites. The yeast of the Sadducees is found in how they hardened their hearts against the power of God and believing the scriptures. They wrongly believed that the resurrection of the dead could not happen and that there were no angels or demons (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop3')"> Acts 23:8</span>).
