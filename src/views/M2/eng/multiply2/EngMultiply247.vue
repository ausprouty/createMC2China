<h3>Jesus Washes His Disciples&rsquo; Feet</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>It was just before the Passover Festival. Jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already prompted Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God;<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples&rsquo; feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, &ldquo;Lord, are you going to wash my feet?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Jesus replied, &ldquo;You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;you shall never wash my feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jesus answered, &ldquo;Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Then, Lord,&rdquo; Simon Peter replied, &ldquo;not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered, &ldquo;Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. &ldquo;Do you understand what I have done for you?&rdquo; he asked them.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;You call me &lsquo;Teacher&rsquo; and &lsquo;Lord,&rsquo; and rightly so, for that is what I am.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another&rsquo;s feet.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.</p>

<h3>Jesus Predicts His Betrayal</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill this passage of Scripture: &lsquo;He who shared my bread has turned against me.&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that I am who I am.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Very truly I tell you, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>After he had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, &ldquo;Very truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, &ldquo;Ask him which one he means.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, &ldquo;Lord, who is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered, &ldquo;It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.&rdquo; Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.</p>

<p>So Jesus told him, &ldquo;What you are about to do, do quickly.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>But no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him.<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the festival, or to give something to the poor.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.</p>

<h3>Jesus Predicts Peter&rsquo;s Denial</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>When he was gone, Jesus said, &ldquo;Now the Son of Man is glorified and God is glorified in him.<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>Simon Peter asked him, &ldquo;Lord, where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jesus replied, &ldquo;Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>Peter asked, &ldquo;Lord, why can&rsquo;t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus answered, &ldquo;Will you really lay down your life for me? Very truly I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times!</p>

<p class="up">Jesus spends the final week of His life teaching at the temple during the day and praying on the Mount of Olives in the evening. On the last night with His disciples, He teaches a lot about leadership. He &ldquo;shows the full extent of His love.&rdquo; Jesus surprises His disciples by taking the role of a household servant, washing the feet of all twelve. None of them had done that! Jesus told them that they should follow His example to be humble, serving one another by doing whatever is needed. In most cultures, servant leadership is seen as being weak, but this is how leadership works in God&rsquo;s Kingdom. As Jesus was sharing the last supper with his closest core team of twelve, He was grieved knowing that one of them would betray Him. Judas had become disillusioned with Jesus&rsquo; leadership and had already struck a deal to help the religious leaders arrest Jesus in a quiet place away from the crowds. Judas opened himself up to be manipulated by Satan. In the midst of betrayal and grief, Jesus commands the disciples that they must love one another.</p>

	<p><span class="for-enrichment"><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said to them, &ldquo;The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>But you are not to be like that.
