	<li class="nobreak-final-final">Peter leads the group to the mountain where Jesus meets with them. They worship Him as the risen savior of the world. It is here that Jesus sums up His life&rsquo;s work and gives them one simple command &ndash; make disciples! All of their training has prepared them for this. Jesus says &ldquo;Go&rdquo; which literally means, &ldquo;as you go through life, make disciples.&rdquo; In the daily activities of life, we should invest in others. He says that this is for everyone, every culture, every tribe, every tongue. The movement of disciple-making should cover the whole world. Jesus promises that He will always be with us as we obey this command. This is the lifestyle that Jesus is asking us to have. Significantly, this event takes place &ldquo;on a mountain in Galilee&rdquo; overlooking the landscape where they were called and trained for His mission, and from where they could see surrounding nations. Jesus&rsquo; final appearance would be a few days later when he ascends from the Mount of Olives, just outside Jerusalem (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop3')"> Acts 1 :1-11</span>).
