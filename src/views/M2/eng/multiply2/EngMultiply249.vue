<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge&rsquo;s seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha).<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is your king,&rdquo; Pilate said to the Jews.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>But they shouted, &ldquo;Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I crucify your king?&rdquo; Pilate asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have no king but Caesar,&rdquo; the chief priests answered.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified.</p>

<h3>The Crucifixion of Jesus</h3>

<p>So the soldiers took charge of Jesus.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha).<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>There they crucified him, and with him two others&mdash;one on each side and Jesus in the middle.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: <span class="small-caps">jesus of nazareth, <span class="small-caps">the king of the jews.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, &ldquo;Do not write &lsquo;The King of the Jews,&rsquo; but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>Pilate answered, &ldquo;What I have written, I have written.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not tear it,&rdquo; they said to one another. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s decide by lot who will get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;They divided my clothes among them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cast lots for my garment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So this is what the soldiers did.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother&rsquo;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, &ldquo;Woman, here is your son,&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>and to the disciple, &ldquo;Here is your mother.&rdquo; From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.</p>

<h3>The Death of Jesus</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>Later, knowing that everything had now been finished, and so that Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, &ldquo;I am thirsty.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus&rsquo; lips.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>When he had received the drink, Jesus said, &ldquo;It is finished.&rdquo; With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</p>

<p class="up">Jesus was betrayed, lied about, treated unjustly, beaten, whipped, and finally nailed to a cross to die between two criminals. In His humanity, Jesus suffered greatly in those last hours of life. God placed the sin of the world on Jesus as an innocent substitute for us. Jesus suffered separation from the Father for the first time. He was forsaken by the Father, who turned His back on Jesus because Jesus was carrying all the weight of the world&rsquo;s sin. The Passover Lamb of God shed His blood and the veil of the temple was torn. Jesus was the last sacrifice. Now we have access to the living God. Those who believe have been adopted into this new family. He made a way to the Father. He laid down His life to pay our debt. On the cross a great exchange happened, &ldquo;God made Him who had no sin to be sin so that we might become the righteousness of God.&rdquo; (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop3')"> 2 Corinthians 5:21</span></p>
