<h3>John Testifies Again About Jesus</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were coming and being baptized.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>(This was before John was put in prison.)<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>An argument developed between some of John&rsquo;s disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>They came to John and said to him, &ldquo;Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan&mdash;the one you testified about&mdash;look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>To this John replied, &ldquo;A person can receive only what is given them from heaven.<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>You yourselves can testify that I said, &lsquo;I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him.&rsquo;<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>He must become greater; I must become less.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth.

<p class="up">John moved his ministry north of Judea to continue baptizing people on the edge of the regions of the Decapolis and Samaria. Meanwhile, Jesus continued his ministry in Judean countryside while John continued his ministry of preparing the way for people to come to Jesus. As John&rsquo;s disciples ask why Jesus&rsquo; ministry was growing bigger than John&rsquo;s, John explains his perspective: he knew who Jesus was and who he was. He knew that the source of real joy was being near Jesus and listening to His voice. John knew that after he heard Jesus speak he could only obey. John modeled dying to self and being obedient to the Father&rsquo;s will.</p>
