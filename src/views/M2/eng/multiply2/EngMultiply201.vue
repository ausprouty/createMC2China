<div class="collapsed" id ="Text3">
<!-- end default revealSummary -->

<p>At its heart, the Prayer-Care-Share (PCS) is a&nbsp;lifestyle&nbsp;demonstrating the gospel&nbsp;by loving our&nbsp;neighbors combined with the proclamation of the&nbsp;gospel as the&nbsp;Lord gives opportunity, all&nbsp;undergirded by prayer.</p>

<p>To live a PCS lifestyle we&nbsp;allow&nbsp;the Holy Spirit to live in&nbsp;and work through us&nbsp;in the following ways&hellip;</p>

<h2><br />
&hellip; PRAYING for others</h2>

<p>Prayer is the first and best thing we can do for&nbsp;the&nbsp;people in our networks (those among whom you do life with - where you live, learn, work, and play).&nbsp;As we&nbsp;pray for people, it is common for God to put it on&nbsp;our hearts to show His&nbsp;love in&nbsp;tangible ways.&hellip;</p>

<h2>&hellip; CARING for others</h2>

<p>You have heard the phrase that people don&rsquo;t care how much you know until&nbsp;they know how much you care. Acts of kindness or care can open ways to&nbsp;communicate the gospel. Those living a PCS lifestyle, respond to the Spirit&rsquo;s&nbsp;leading in prayer to show care for people around them.</p>

<h2>&hellip;.SHARING THE GOSPEL with others</h2>

<p>As we pray for people and demonstrate care in tangible ways, God will often&nbsp;open up doors for us to have&nbsp;spiritual conversations. The ultimate act of love is&nbsp;sharing the gospel of&nbsp;Christ with people in our&nbsp;networks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The PCS lifestyle is a rhythm of life where we put the&nbsp;needs and interests of&nbsp;others above ourselves because of what Jesus has done for us.</p>
