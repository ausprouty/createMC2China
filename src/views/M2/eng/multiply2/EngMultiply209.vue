<h3>Jesus Changes Water Into Wine</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus&rsquo; mother was there,<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>When the wine was gone, Jesus&rsquo; mother said to him, &ldquo;They have no more wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Woman, why do you involve me?&rdquo; Jesus replied. &ldquo;My hour has not yet come.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>His mother said to the servants, &ldquo;Do whatever he tells you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said to the servants, &ldquo;Fill the jars with water&rdquo;; so they filled them to the brim.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Then he told them, &ldquo;Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did so,<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>and said, &ldquo;Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs through which he revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</p>

	Jesus is a real person, with a real family, from a real town in Israel. His followers get a chance to meet Jesus&rsquo; family. But they also got a chance to see His deity through the miracle of turning water into wine. This was the first sign that revealed His glory. As His disciples grew in their knowledge and experience of Jesus, their faith also grew. Jesus established these early disciples by challenging them to come and see, then by spending time with them. The disciples told others about Jesus as they began to see glimpses of His deity.</li>
