<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>(This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.)<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>And everyone went to their own town to register.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>But the angel said to them, &ldquo;Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people.<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child,<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, &ldquo;Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel&rdquo; (which means &ldquo;God with us&rdquo;).</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.</p>
