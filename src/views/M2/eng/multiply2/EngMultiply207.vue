	<li class="nobreak-final-final">Jesus was led into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan himself. After 40 days of temptations of every kind, the enemy comes again to Jesus. Jesus is now weak, tired and very, very hungry. Satan&rsquo;s temptation was a direct attack on the truth of God&rsquo;s words. This has been Satan&rsquo;s strategy from the beginning when he used it with Adam and Eve (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop12')"> Genesis 3</span>).&nbsp;

	<p><sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>The woman said to the serpent, &ldquo;We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>but God did say, &lsquo;You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;You will not certainly die,&rdquo; the serpent said to the woman.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.</p>

	<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the <span class="small-caps">Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the <span class="small-caps">Lord God among the trees of the garden.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>But the <span class="small-caps">Lord God called to the man, &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through painful toil you will eat food from it<br />
