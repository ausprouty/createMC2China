<h3>Jesus Heals an Official&rsquo;s Son</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">43&nbsp;</sup>After the two days he left for Galilee.<sup class="versenum">44&nbsp;</sup>(Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.)<sup class="versenum">45&nbsp;</sup>When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, for they also had been there.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">46&nbsp;</sup>Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.<sup class="versenum">47&nbsp;</sup>When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">48&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Unless you people see signs and wonders,&rdquo; Jesus told him, &ldquo;you will never believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">49&nbsp;</sup>The royal official said, &ldquo;Sir, come down before my child dies.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">50&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; Jesus replied, &ldquo;your son will live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man took Jesus at his word and departed.<sup class="versenum">51&nbsp;</sup>While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living.<sup class="versenum">52&nbsp;</sup>When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, &ldquo;Yesterday, at one in the afternoon, the fever left him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">53&nbsp;</sup>Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, &ldquo;Your son will live.&rdquo; So he and his whole household believed.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">54&nbsp;</sup>This was the second sign Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee.</p>

<p class="up">Jesus travels north to his hometown of Nazareth in the district of Galilee. Word of His outburst at the temple had spread and all the people are wondering about Him. While Jesus revisited Cana, some of the news about Him reached a desperate royal official in the large city of Capernaum. This official was most likely a Roman who hoped Jesus could heal his child. Up until now, there was no record of Jesus healing anyone, but that did not stop this man from putting his faith in Jesus. When Jesus promised that his child was healed, the royal official believed and obeyed Jesus. The result was that his son was healed and his whole family believed and were saved. Faith is taking Jesus at His word, believing Him and then acting in obedience.</p>
