<p class="up">Jesus begins the first of six outreach events. He is training His young ministry team to reach the crowds with the Good News that He is the Messiah. The first outreach is in their place of worship, the local synagogue. There they find a group of religious but lost people. Jesus uses the first five books of the Bible to share with them who He is. He combines this with the message that it is time to repent because the Kingdom of God is here. The crowd recognizes He is different and are amazed that Jesus has command over evil spirits. It seems this is the first time Jesus has cast out a demon and news about this event spreads quickly. The demon demonstrated that he knew exactly who Jesus was, &ldquo;the Holy One of God&rdquo;.</p>
