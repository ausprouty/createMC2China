<h3>Jesus and the Miraculous Catch of Fish</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Galilee. It happened this way:<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>Simon Peter, Thomas (also known as Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out to fish,&rdquo; Simon Peter told them, and they said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo; So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>He called out to them, &ldquo;Friends, haven&rsquo;t you any fish?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; they answered.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>He said, &ldquo;Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.&rdquo; When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &ldquo;It is the Lord!&rdquo; As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, &ldquo;It is the Lord,&rdquo; he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Bring some of the fish you have just caught.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Come and have breakfast.&rdquo; None of the disciples dared ask him, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; They knew it was the Lord.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.</p>

<h3>Jesus Reinstates Peter</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, &ldquo;Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know that I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;Feed my lambs.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Again Jesus said, &ldquo;Simon son of John, do you love me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He answered, &ldquo;Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;Take care of my sheep.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>The third time he said to him, &ldquo;Simon son of John, do you love me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, &ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;Feed my sheep.<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>Very truly I tell you, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, &ldquo;Lord, who is going to betray you?&rdquo;)<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>When Peter saw him, he asked, &ldquo;Lord, what about him?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered, &ldquo;If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Because of this, the rumor spread among the believers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, &ldquo;If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.</p>

<p class="up">After rising from the dead, Jesus appears to His disciples on several occasions. As many as 500 people see Him at one time (1 Corinthians 15:6). On this occasion, in Galilee, He visits His leaders who have returned to their old life of fishing. When they experience the miraculous provision of fish like they did when Jesus called them a few years before, they recognize that it is Jesus. Peter is excited to see the Lord again. Jesus talks with him about his heart commitment. He asks if Peter loves Him more than his former way of life. If so, then Peter should care about the things that Jesus cares about. He should shepherd others just like Jesus. Once again Peter is restored and called to follow Jesus and continue the work of fishing for and caring for men. This is the last time we see Peter going back to fishing.</p>
