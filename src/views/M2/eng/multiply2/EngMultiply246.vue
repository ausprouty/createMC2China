<p><sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them.<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, &ldquo;Why are you untying the colt?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>They replied, &ldquo;The Lord needs it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it.<sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">41&nbsp;</sup>As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it<sup class="versenum">42&nbsp;</sup>and said, &ldquo;If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace&mdash;but now it is hidden from your eyes.<sup class="versenum">43&nbsp;</sup>The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.<sup class="versenum">44&nbsp;</sup>They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls.

<p class="up">A prophecy given 500 years earlier is fulfilled before these young leaders&rsquo; eyes. A king riding on a donkey will approach Jerusalem! (Zechariah 9:9). People were praising God as Jesus descended down the Mount of Olives on the road into the city of Jerusalem. The Pharisees understood the Messianic implications of the situation and told Jesus to tell His disciples to be quiet. But Jesus knew the importance that this testimony played in the Father&rsquo;s plan. As Jesus approaches the city, He begins to weep. Jesus was grieved because He knew most of the people did not realize who He was or the significance of this event. He also knew that one day judgement would come on the city because of their unbelief; Jerusalem would be destroyed by the Roman army. Once again, we see Jesus&rsquo; passion displayed as he drives out the money changers who had returned to their old practices, taking advantage of people coming to worship God. Jesus not only showed passion for the Father&rsquo;s reputation, but compassion for the poor and the foreigner.</p>
