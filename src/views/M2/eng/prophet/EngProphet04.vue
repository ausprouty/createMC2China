<p>The descendants of Jacob, Abraham&rsquo;s grandson, settled in Egypt. They were enslaved by the Egyptians as their numbers increased. God sent Moses to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to demand their freedom. Each time Pharaoh rejected God&rsquo;s demands, He sent disasters as punishments upon Egypt. This happened ten times. The final punishment was for God to kill all of the firstborn sons and firstborn cattle throughout the land.</p>

<h3>The Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>The <span class="small-caps">Lord said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt,<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb for his family, one for each household.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats.<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the members of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without yeast.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Do not eat the meat raw or boiled in water, but roast it over a fire&mdash;with the head, legs and internal organs.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it.<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the <span class="small-caps">Lord&rsquo;s Passover.</span></span></p>

<p>There was only one way to avoid this catastrophe. Only those who obeyed God&rsquo;s requirement would be saved. God commanded Abraham&rsquo;s children to sacrifice an unblemished lamb and put its blood on their doorposts. There was weeping throughout the land of Egypt as the firstborn sons and cattle of each family died. God mercifully passed over those who had sacrificed a lamb, and they were saved. With this final punishment, Pharaoh allowed the people to go free from Egypt.</p>

<p>After they left Egypt, God also gave The Law to the people so that man could understand the kind of life God required from them.&nbsp; The Day of Atonement was God&rsquo;s provision for man so that relationship with Him can be restored.</p>

<p>Read Hebrews 9:22: &ldquo;In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sin.&rdquo;</p>
