<p class="up">To follow Jesus means that we will obey His command to be His witnesses. But we can only do what is needed with the help of the power of the Holy Spirit in our lives. Only as He empowers us, can we be effective witnesses. God&rsquo;s desire is that we witness to everyone--those like us and those not like us; those near to us and those who live all over the world. Knowing how to share the gospel is a key skill in field 2 of the Kingdom Growth Process.</p>
