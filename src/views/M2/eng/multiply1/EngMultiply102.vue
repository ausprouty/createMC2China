<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;When he came to his senses, he said, &lsquo;How many of my father&rsquo;s hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.&rsquo;<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>So he got up and went to his father.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;The son said to him, &lsquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.&rsquo;</p>
