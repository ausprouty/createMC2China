<p class="back">Since everyone is called to follow Jesus and fish for men, we should realize there are only two kinds of people in the world-- lost and saved. Lost people need to follow Jesus. Saved people need to learn to fish for the lost. When you see the world as two types of people, then your daily interactions get much simpler. If you meet a lost person, witness to them. If you meet a saved person, offer to train them. It can&rsquo;t get much easier than that!&nbsp;</p>
