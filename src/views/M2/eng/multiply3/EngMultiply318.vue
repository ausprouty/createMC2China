<h3>Aeneas and Dorcas</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>As Peter traveled about the country, he went to visit the Lord&rsquo;s people who lived in Lydda.<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>There he found a man named Aeneas, who was paralyzed and had been bedridden for eight years.<sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Aeneas,&rdquo; Peter said to him, &ldquo;Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and roll up your mat.&rdquo; Immediately Aeneas got up.<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (in Greek her name is Dorcas); she was always doing good and helping the poor.<sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>About that time she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room.<sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>Lydda was near Joppa; so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him and urged him, &ldquo;Please come at once!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>Peter went with them, and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, &ldquo;Tabitha, get up.&rdquo; She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up.<sup class="versenum">41&nbsp;</sup>He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called for the believers, especially the widows, and presented her to them alive.<sup class="versenum">42&nbsp;</sup>This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord.<sup class="versenum">43&nbsp;</sup>Peter stayed in Joppa for some time with a tanner named Simon.</p>

<p class="up">Peter begins to travel outside of Jerusalem to visit believers who have settled in other towns. The Spirit uses him to perform many miracles and lead many people to Christ in Lydda and Joppa. These are the first churches outside of Jerusalem that Peter helps to start. Directed by the Spirit through prayer, Peter raises Tabitha to life in the same way that he saw Jesus raise Jarius&rsquo; daughter (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop1')"> Mark 5:38-42</span>).&nbsp;</p>

The child is not dead but asleep.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>But they laughed at him.</p>

<p>After he put them all out, he took the child&rsquo;s father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was.<sup class="versenum">41&nbsp;</sup>He took her by the hand and said to her, <em>&ldquo;Talitha koum!&rdquo;</em> (which means &ldquo;Little girl, I say to you, get up!&rdquo;).<sup class="versenum">42&nbsp;</sup>Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old).

Tabitha is an example of a woman who was active in ministry by caring for others and helping to provide for widows in the area. Peter shows growth in his understanding of grace by being willing to stay at the home of a tanner, a profession seen as unclean by Jewish religious cultural terms.
