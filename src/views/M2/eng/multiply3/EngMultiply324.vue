<p class="up">The leadership team in the church at Antioch consisted of five men with different gifts and different backgrounds. The Spirit directed them to send out Saul and Barnabas, two members of the team, to make disciples and start new churches in new territories. Barnabas and Saul decided to take Barnabas&rsquo; young cousin, John Mark, with them as an assistant. The first place they visited was Barnabas&rsquo; home of Cyprus, an island off the coast of Syria. It was also believers from Cyprus that had help start the church in Antioch (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop1')"> Acts 11:20</span>).&nbsp;</p>

<div class="popup invisible" id="pop1"><!-- begin bible -->
<div>
<div>
<p><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus.</p>
</div>
</div>
<!-- end bible --></div>
These relationships likely influenced their plans. As a Roman citizen, Saul used his Gentile name, Paul, while he traveled. Paul and Barnabas are introduced to the governor of the island through a Jewish sorcerer which led to major spiritual conflict. Paul did not respond with fear but with the authority of Jesus (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop2')"> Matthew 28:18-20</span>)&nbsp;

<div class="popup invisible" id="pop2"><!-- begin bible -->
<div>
<div>
<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus came to them and said, &ldquo;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

to overcome the demonic opposition. The conversion of the governor was another major milestone, it was the first time a Roman political ruler becomes a follower of Christ.
