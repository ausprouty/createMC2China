<h3>Paul&rsquo;s Vision of the Man of Macedonia</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, &ldquo;Come over to Macedonia and help us.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.</p>

<h3>Lydia&rsquo;s Conversion in Philippi</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day we went on to Neapolis.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>From there we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that district of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>One of those listening was a woman from the city of Thyatira named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth. She was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul&rsquo;s message.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. &ldquo;If you consider me a believer in the Lord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;come and stay at my house.&rdquo; And she persuaded us.</p>

<p class="up">Paul had plans of going into the province of Asia, which is west of Galatia, but the Lord had other plans for the ministry team. After being prevented by the Holy Spirit from going west into Asia and northeast into Bithynia, the team traveled northwest to the city of Troas on the west coast of modern day Turkey. Luke, the author of the book of Acts, joins the team in Troas as noted by the use of &ldquo;we&rdquo; (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop1')"> Acts 16:10</span>).&nbsp;</p>

While seeking the Lord for their next steps, Jesus gave Paul a vision. Listening to the Holy Spirit and considering Paul&rsquo;s vision, they concluded the Lord was leading them to go to the province of Macedonia. Upon arriving, they went to the strategically important city of Philippi. The Lord led them to a person of peace named Lydia, a businesswoman from the province of Asia. She not only welcomed the message and the ministry team, but she led her whole household to faith in Jesus. As in other stories, the first act of obedience for these new believers was to be baptized.
