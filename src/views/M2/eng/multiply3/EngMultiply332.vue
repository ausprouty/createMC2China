While seeking the Lord for their next steps, Jesus gave Paul a vision. Listening to the Holy Spirit and considering Paul&rsquo;s vision, they concluded the Lord was leading them to go to the province of Macedonia. Upon arriving, they went to the strategically important city of Philippi. The Lord led them to a person of peace named Lydia, a businesswoman from the province of Asia. She not only welcomed the message and the ministry team, but she led her whole household to faith in Jesus. As in other stories, the first act of obedience for these new believers was to be baptized.
