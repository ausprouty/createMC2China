<h3>In Lystra and Derbe</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>In Lystra there sat a man who was lame. He had been that way from birth and had never walked.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>and called out, &ldquo;Stand up on your feet!&rdquo; At that, the man jumped up and began to walk.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, &ldquo;The gods have come down to us in human form!&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting:<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Friends, why are you doing this? We too are only human, like you. We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>In the past, he let all nations go their own way.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe.</p>

<p class="up">Unlike the other cities Paul and Barnabas visited, Lystra was a smaller, rural city that did not have a synagogue. The local people in Lystra still practiced their native religion and spoke their local language. Just as Jesus and Peter had healed the lame (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop5')"> Matthew 15:30-31</span>;&nbsp;</p>

<div class="popup invisible" id="pop5"><!-- begin bible -->

<p><sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them.<sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer&mdash;at three in the afternoon.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>Now a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, &ldquo;Look at us!&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Then Peter said, &ldquo;Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man&rsquo;s feet and ankles became strong.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>When all the people saw him walking and praising God,<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</p>

Paul also responded to the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s prompting by healing a man lame from birth. Confusion followed as people interpreted the miracle through their own religion. They mistakenly concluded that Paul and Barnabas were gods, but there were some people who believed their message (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop3')"> Acts 14:20</span>).&nbsp;

<div class="popup invisible" id="pop3"><!-- begin bible -->

Even after facing violent persecution, Paul boldly went back to the city to be with the new believers. Later Paul would write these words, &ldquo;everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted&rdquo; (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop4')"> 2 Timothy 3:12</span>).&nbsp;

<div class="popup invisible" id="pop4"><!-- begin bible -->

<div>
<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,</p>

They traveled to the next town, Derbe, where they also led many people to the Lord.
