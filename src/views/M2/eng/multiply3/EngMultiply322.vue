<h3>The Church in Antioch</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that broke out when Stephen was killed traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, spreading the word only among Jews.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>The Lord&rsquo;s hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>News of this reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>When he arrived and saw what the grace of God had done, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.)<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>The disciples, as each one was able, decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in Judea.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.</p>

<p class="up">Our past several stories have been focused on Peter, but he was not the only believer who was active during this time. The believers that fled Jerusalem during Saul&rsquo;s persecution (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop1')"> Acts 8:1</span>)&nbsp;</p>

were also sharing their faith, but only with other Jews. However, some of the Greek-speaking Jews from the island of Cyprus and the area of North Africa called Cyrene (modern day Libya) shared with non-Jewish people in the big multicultural city of Antioch in Syria. A large number turned to the Lord and a church began in Antioch. This was a 2nd generation church started by ordinary believers. Barnabas, who was originally from Cyprus, was sent by the Jerusalem church to validate what was taking place. He recognized the Lord was at work and realized that Saul was the perfect one to help establish this young Gentile church. It is in Antioch that the name Christian is first used to describe disciples of Jesus. The Gentile believers showed their connection to the Jewish believers by generously sending financial aid to the Jerusalem church.
