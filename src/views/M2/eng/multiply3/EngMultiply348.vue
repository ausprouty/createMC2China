<h3>Paul&rsquo;s Trial Before Felix</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum=">1</sup> Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: &ldquo;We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.<sup class="versenum">[7]&nbsp;</sup><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>The other Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: &ldquo;I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense.<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>However, I admit that I worship the God of our ancestors as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets,<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>and I have the same hope in God as these men themselves have, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings.<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin&mdash;<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: &lsquo;It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. &ldquo;When Lysias the commander comes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will decide your case.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>As Paul talked about righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison.</p>

<p class="up">The Jewish persecutors were violent and prejudiced. The Romans were open-minded and went out of their way to operate by law and order. Paul is trapped between two powers: Jerusalem and Rome, religious and civil, hostile and friendly. Although powerless and vulnerable, he is confident that the Romans have no complaint against him and that the Jews have no legal case. He also has confidence in the Lord&rsquo;s promise that he will testify in Rome. The Jewish lawyer, Tertullus, dishonestly flatters the Roman Governor and then accuses Paul of three crimes: causing riots, being a Christian ringleader, and profaning the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. Paul affirmed four points: I worship the God of our fathers, I believe everything that agrees with the Law, I have the same hope in God as these men, and I strive as much as they do to keep my conscience clear. Paul used the opportunity to teach the governor about faith in Jesus, righteousness, self-control and judgement. He modeled for us how to be a faithful, bold, yet very respectful witness in any circumstance.</p>
