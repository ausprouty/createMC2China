&nbsp;this new community is called church, therefore, these verses provide the basic characteristics of what a local church should practice. A church is characterized by baptized believers who commit to meet together regularly for worship, fellowship, teaching of the Word, prayer, the Lord&rsquo;s supper, ministry, witness, giving and appointed servant leaders. We see them practicing the same qualities Jesus modeled in his ministry: Holy Spirit dependence, prayer, obedience to the Kingdom plan, ministry of the Word, worship of the Father, and intentional relationships in a missional community.
