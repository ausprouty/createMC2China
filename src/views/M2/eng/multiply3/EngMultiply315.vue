<h3>Philip and the Ethiopian</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, &ldquo;Go south to the road&mdash;the desert road&mdash;that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of the Kandake (which means &ldquo;queen of the Ethiopians&rdquo;). This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship,<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the Book of Isaiah the prophet.<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>The Spirit told Philip, &ldquo;Go to that chariot and stay near it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. &ldquo;Do you understand what you are reading?&rdquo; Philip asked.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;How can I,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;unless someone explains it to me?&rdquo; So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>This is the passage of Scripture the eunuch was reading:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was led like a sheep to the slaughter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as a lamb before its shearer is silent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so he did not open his mouth.<br />
<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>In his humiliation he was deprived of justice.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can speak of his descendants?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his life was taken from the earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>The eunuch asked Philip, &ldquo;Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, &ldquo;Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">[37]&nbsp;</sup><sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him.<sup class="versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.<sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.</p>

<p class="up">The Spirit interrupted Philip&rsquo;s successful ministry in Samaria by sending him to the southernmost point of Israel to meet a very strategic person of peace. Philip showed his obedient heart and a sensitivity to the Spirit by going without knowing the details of why he was being sent. The Ethiopian leader he met was a non-Jewish man who had accepted the Jewish faith. As a non-Jewish person and a eunuch (someone who had been castrated in order to serve a female court), he would not be considered fully acceptable to the Jewish faith. But Jesus was ready to accept him! The Lord had been preparing the Ethiopian&rsquo;s heart and used Philip to tell him the good news. Philip followed the same pattern of baptism that he learned while in Jerusalem and also used in Samaria. The Ethiopian believed and was immediately baptized. Philip shared the gospel in all the cities along the coast of Israel. He finally settled in Caesarea, which was the large international port city of Israel and the seat of Roman power in the province.</p>
