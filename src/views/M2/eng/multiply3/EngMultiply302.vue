<h3>Matthias Chosen to Replace Judas</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day&rsquo;s walk from the city.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>In those days Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty)<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>and said, &ldquo;Brothers and sisters, the Scripture had to be fulfilled in which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>He was one of our number and shared in our ministry.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>(With the payment he received for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;it is written in the Book of Psalms:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May his place be deserted;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let there be no one to dwell in it,&rsquo;</p>

<p>and,</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May another take his place of leadership.&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus was living among us,<sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>beginning from John&rsquo;s baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>So they nominated two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Then they prayed, &ldquo;Lord, you know everyone&rsquo;s heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.</p>

<p class="up">There were only 120 disciples left together in Jerusalem at this time. Jesus&rsquo; mother, brothers and sisters were now included in the list of believers. This story shows that although their names were not listed in the Gospels, there were many others who followed Jesus from the time that He was baptized until He returned to heaven. Jesus selected the initial twelve Apostles from among many possible candidates. The remaining eleven determined that the main criteria of selecting a replacement was the amount of time they had witnessed Jesus&rsquo; life and ministry. This is the last time we see the Old Testament way of casting lots being used to make decisions. Jesus never used the casting of lots to discern the Father&rsquo;s will because He listened to and obeyed the Spirit. After the Spirit is sent, discerning God&rsquo;s will is done through submitting to and keeping in step with the Spirit.</p>
