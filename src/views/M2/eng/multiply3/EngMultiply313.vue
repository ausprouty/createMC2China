<p class="up">Stephen showed his skill in handling the Word of God and confronted the leaders with words of truth. He accused them of disobeying God, sinning against the Holy Spirit, the Law, and Jesus the Messiah. When Stephen told them he could see Jesus, &ldquo;the Son of Man&rdquo;, the leaders erupted into violence against him. Jesus had taught the disciples that the people who killed them would think they were serving God (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop3')"> Matthew 10:16-39</span>).</p>

Jesus was seen standing (not sitting) at the place of honor next to God the Father watching over all these events, but He didn&rsquo;t rescue Stephen from death. Stephen prayed directly to Jesus while he was dying, and his request reflected that he understood Jesus&rsquo; equality with God (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop4')"> Acts 7:59-60</span>).

This story also introduces a young religious leader named Saul who approved of all that was happening. Saul began going everywhere to destroy the church. Both men and women were persecuted for their faith and many of the believers left Jerusalem to flee from the violence.
