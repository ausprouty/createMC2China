<h3>Paul Arrested</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>When the seven days were nearly over, some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul at the temple. They stirred up the whole crowd and seized him,<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>shouting, &ldquo;Fellow Israelites, help us! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people and our law and this place. And besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>(They had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul and assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple.)</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>The whole city was aroused, and the people came running from all directions. Seizing Paul, they dragged him from the temple, and immediately the gates were shut.<sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>While they were trying to kill him, news reached the commander of the Roman troops that the whole city of Jerusalem was in an uproar.<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>He at once took some officers and soldiers and ran down to the crowd. When the rioters saw the commander and his soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>The commander came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done.<sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>Some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another, and since the commander could not get at the truth because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks.<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>When Paul reached the steps, the violence of the mob was so great he had to be carried by the soldiers.<sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>The crowd that followed kept shouting, &ldquo;Get rid of him!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="up">Jews from the province of Asia were very familiar with Paul and Trophimus from Paul&rsquo;s long stay in Ephesus. They saw an opportunity to try to stop Paul, so they stirred up the crowd against him. When they came against Paul, he was actually in the temple practicing purification that the Jewish law required. The Jews&rsquo; accusations were false, but their actions demonstrated the common misunderstandings about what Paul was teaching. The Jews were so passionate about their religion that they quickly moved to respond with violence. The Lord used the Roman authorities to rescue Paul from the mob. The prophecies made by the Spirit came true (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop1')"> Acts 21:4</span>,&nbsp;</p>
