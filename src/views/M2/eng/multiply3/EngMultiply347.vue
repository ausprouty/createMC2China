<h3>The Plot to Kill Paul</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>The next morning some Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>More than forty men were involved in this plot.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>They went to the chief priests and the elders and said, &ldquo;We have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>Now then, you and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him before you on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about his case. We are ready to kill him before he gets here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>But when the son of Paul&rsquo;s sister heard of this plot, he went into the barracks and told Paul.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, &ldquo;Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>So he took him to the commander.</p>

<p>The centurion said, &ldquo;Paul, the prisoner, sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside and asked, &ldquo;What is it you want to tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>He said: &ldquo;Some Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul before the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>Don&rsquo;t give in to them, because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now, waiting for your consent to their request.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>The commander dismissed the young man with this warning: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell anyone that you have reported this to me.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Paul Transferred to Caesarea</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Then he called two of his centurions and ordered them, &ldquo;Get ready a detachment of two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at nine tonight.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Provide horses for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>He wrote a letter as follows:</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>Claudius Lysias,</p>

<p>To His Excellency, Governor Felix:</p>

<p>Greetings.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>This man was seized by the Jews and they were about to kill him, but I came with my troops and rescued him, for I had learned that he is a Roman citizen.<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>I wanted to know why they were accusing him, so I brought him to their Sanhedrin.<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>I found that the accusation had to do with questions about their law, but there was no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>When I was informed of a plot to be carried out against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also ordered his accusers to present to you their case against him.</p>
</div>

<p><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul with them during the night and brought him as far as Antipatris.<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>The next day they let the cavalry go on with him, while they returned to the barracks.<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>When the cavalry arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him.<sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>The governor read the letter and asked what province he was from. Learning that he was from Cilicia,<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>he said, &ldquo;I will hear your case when your accusers get here.&rdquo; Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod&rsquo;s palace.</p>

<p class="up">For Paul&rsquo;s entire Christian life, the Jews who rejected Jesus also rejected him and the gospel. We are reminded of Jesus&rsquo; teaching, &ldquo;if they reject you, they reject me, and the one who sent me&rdquo; (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop1')"> Luke 10:16</span>).&nbsp;</p>

The Jews viewed Paul as a blasphemer and his message as a threat to their own self-serving nationalistic view of God&rsquo;s purpose. We see God&rsquo;s sovereignty through the use of Paul&rsquo;s nephew learning about the plot to have him assassinated. In response, the commander sent 470 Roman troops to transport Paul safely the 112 km (70 miles) to the seaside city of Caesarea. Governor Felix kept him under guard in the summer palace of former King Herod the Great (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop2')"> Matthew 2:1</span>;&nbsp;

This example from Paul&rsquo;s life shows us that the Lord is with those who pursue His Kingdom purpose and that the safest place to be is in the Father&rsquo;s will.
