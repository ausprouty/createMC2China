<h3>Paul&rsquo;s Arrival at Rome</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>After three months we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered in the island&mdash;it was an Alexandrian ship with the figurehead of the twin gods Castor and Pollux.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>From there we set sail and arrived at Rhegium. The next day the south wind came up, and on the following day we reached Puteoli.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>There we found some brothers and sisters who invited us to spend a week with them. And so we came to Rome.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>The brothers and sisters there had heard that we were coming, and they traveled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At the sight of these people Paul thanked God and was encouraged.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>When we got to Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with a soldier to guard him.</p>

<h3>Paul Preaches at Rome Under Guard</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Three days later he called together the local Jewish leaders. When they had assembled, Paul said to them: &ldquo;My brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>They examined me and wanted to release me, because I was not guilty of any crime deserving death.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>The Jews objected, so I was compelled to make an appeal to Caesar. I certainly did not intend to bring any charge against my own people.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>For this reason I have asked to see you and talk with you. It is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>They replied, &ldquo;We have not received any letters from Judea concerning you, and none of our people who have come from there has reported or said anything bad about you.<sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>But we want to hear what your views are, for we know that people everywhere are talking against this sect.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, and came in even larger numbers to the place where he was staying. He witnessed to them from morning till evening, explaining about the kingdom of God, and from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets he tried to persuade them about Jesus.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Some were convinced by what he said, but others would not believe.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>They disagreed among themselves and began to leave after Paul had made this final statement: &ldquo;The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors when he said through Isaiah the prophet:</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go to this people and say,<br />
&ldquo;You will be ever hearing but never understanding;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.&rdquo;<br />
<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>For this people&rsquo;s heart has become calloused;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they hardly hear with their ears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they have closed their eyes.<br />
Otherwise they might see with their eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear with their ears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand with their hearts<br />
and turn, and I would heal them.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Therefore I want you to know that God&rsquo;s salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">[29]&nbsp;</sup></p>

<p><sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.<sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>He proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;with all boldness and without hindrance!</p>

<p class="up">The Roman believers would have received Paul&rsquo;s letter almost 3 years earlier. Paul kept the pattern of starting with the Jews, giving them evidence from scripture that Jesus is the Messiah, and then starting to share with the non-Jewish people. The Jewish leader&rsquo;s testimony gives a glimpse into the spread of the gospel, &ldquo;we know people everywhere are talking against this sect&rdquo; (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop1')"> Acts 28:22</span>).&nbsp;</p>

Paul was able to witness to his Roman guards and even members of Caesar&rsquo;s household became believers (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop2')"> Philippians 4:22</span>).&nbsp;

During his time in Rome, Paul continued coaching and mentoring believers in Philippi, Colossae and Ephesus through letter writing.
