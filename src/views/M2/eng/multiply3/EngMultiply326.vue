<p class="up">One week after Paul originally shared at the Synagogue, many more people came to hear God&rsquo;s word. Jewish leaders of the synagogue became jealous, so they began speaking against what Paul was saying. Instead of arguing with the leaders, Paul understood that Jesus was shifting their focus to minister to the interested Gentiles, and many were saved. We learn that even though the Lord sovereignly knows who will believe the message of the gospel, the work of sharing the gospel still needs to take place (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop1')"> Acts 13:48</span>).&nbsp;</p>

After just a few weeks a church started in Antioch of Pisidia. As a result, the new believers spread the word of the Lord throughout the whole region (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop2')"> Acts 13:49</span>).&nbsp;

Growing hostility and persecution from city leaders forced Paul and Barnabas to leave the area. Even though they did not stay very long in this city, Paul and Barnabas left behind many disciples who were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.
