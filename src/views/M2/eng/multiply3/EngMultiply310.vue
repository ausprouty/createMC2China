<h3>The Choosing of the Seven</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>In those days when the number of disciples was increasing, the Hellenistic Jews among them complained against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, &ldquo;It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Brothers and sisters, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; also Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism.<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>So the word of God spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.</p>

<p class="up">As the church grew, they faced threats from outside and inside: physical violence from governing authorities and moral compromise. The Jerusalem church was almost 100% Jewish, but they represented two distinct cultures: local Jews who grew up in Palestine and Jews who grew up in the Greek speaking provinces of the Roman Empire. The social issues of the city spilled over into the church. Having started in unity, the church was now experiencing grumbling about what appeared to be unequal caring and management of resources. The solution was to have the Greek speaking believers select seven men from among them to help. They looked for men who were well respected, filled with the Spirit, and filled with wisdom. The Apostles restructured the leadership roles by empowering these new leaders to lead the ministry of care and the management of resources. This change allowed the Apostles to focus on prayer and the teaching of the Word. This story also includes the first summary statement found in the book of Acts: the word of God kept spreading, the number of believers increased, and many Jewish priests became believers too (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop1')"> Acts 6:7</span>).</p>
