<h3>Paul in Ephesus</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>and asked them, &ldquo;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They answered, &ldquo;No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>So Paul asked, &ldquo;Then what baptism did you receive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John&rsquo;s baptism,&rdquo; they replied.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Paul said, &ldquo;John&rsquo;s baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>There were about twelve men in all.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord.</p>

<p class="up">When Paul arrived in Ephesus, he met 12 men who knew John the Baptist&rsquo;s teaching but did not know about Jesus or the sending of the Holy Spirit. After Paul taught them, they are willing to be identified with Jesus by being baptized in his name. These new believers experienced the Holy Spirit by receiving the gift of prophecy. Even though Aquila and Priscilla had been sharing the gospel in Ephesus, a movement did not start until Paul started teaching there daily. As a result, the gospel spread from the provincial capital to the whole province of Asia (about 8 million people) in only two years. Colossae was one of the cities of the province of Asia that was reached during this time. Read <span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop1')"> Colossians 1:3-8</span>.&nbsp;</p>

Paul&rsquo;s strategic role continued to shift. He coached the ongoing movements in four other provinces through letters and ambassadors. His long stay in the city of Ephesus allowed Paul to have his biggest impact. Leaders were being raised up from the harvest and sent out to plant churches.
