<p>Saul stayed for a few days with the believers in Damascus. <sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>All those who heard him were astonished and asked, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn&rsquo;t he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Messiah.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>After many days had gone by, there was a conspiracy among the Jews to kill him,<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>but Saul learned of their plan. Day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple.<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus.<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>He talked and debated with the Hellenistic Jews, but they tried to kill him.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>When the believers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.</p>

<p class="up">The believers in Damascus were surprised by Saul. Instead of arresting them, Saul began preaching Jesus as the living Son of God. Saul&rsquo;s advanced education allowed him to immediately apply his knowledge of scripture to give persuasive proof that Jesus was the promised Messiah. Jesus taught that people with such understanding were able to bring out treasures from the Old Testament and from new teachings about the Kingdom (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop1')"> Matthew 13:52</span>).&nbsp;</p>

<div class="popup invisible" id="pop1"><!-- begin bible -->

<p><sup class="versenum">52&nbsp;</sup>He said to them, &ldquo;Therefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.&rdquo;</p>

Saul was so powerful in his witness that the Jews could not argue with him, so they tried to kill him in Damascus. When Saul came to Jerusalem, only Barnabas accepted him and endorsed him to the Apostles. Saul&rsquo;s life was threatened again, so the disciples sent him to his hometown of Tarsus, in the province of Cilicia, about 930 km northwest of Jerusalem. This story includes the second summary statement found in the book of Acts: the church had peace and grew in numbers as it lived out of a deep reverence for God&rsquo;s holiness and power (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop2')"> Acts 9:31</span>).&nbsp;
