<h3>In Thessalonica</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>When Paul and his companions had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>explaining and proving that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead. &ldquo;This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah,&rdquo; he said.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>But other Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason&rsquo;s house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd.<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city officials, shouting: &ldquo;These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here,<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar&rsquo;s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go.</p>

<h3>In Berea</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>As soon as it was night, the believers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue.<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>As a result, many of them believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>But when the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, some of them went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>The believers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="up">Paul and team left Philippi and went to the provincial capital of Thessalonica. Paul continued his practice of going to the synagogue to find spiritually interested people. A church was planted with some Jews, many Greek men, and some prominent women of the city. The pattern of persecution often started with jealousy from the local Jewish leaders. This time they brought charges of causing civil unrest. The local authorities made Jason, who was hosting Paul and the team, pay a fine (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop1')"> Acts 17:7-9</span>).&nbsp;</p>

Paul and team were forced to leave the young church after only a few months. However, their church planting mission continued in Berea, another town in the province of Macedonia. The Bereans learned eagerly from Paul and examined the Scriptures to confirm that Paul taught the truth. The new church was made up of many of the Berean Jews, prominent Greek women, and many Greek men. The hostile Jews from Thessalonica pursued the mission team all the way to Berea, finally forcing Paul to leave the province.
