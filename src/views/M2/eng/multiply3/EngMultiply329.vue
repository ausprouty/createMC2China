<p class="up">After planting another church in Derbe, Paul and Barnabas decide to revisit the new churches on their return journey to Syrian Antioch. Their purpose was to strengthen the faith of the new believers and stabilize the churches by identifying and appointing local elders in each new church. Even though these churches were only a few months old, they were led by new believers. Part of the foundational discipleship Paul taught the new believers was how to respond to persecution and the reality of hardships that come with boldly following Jesus (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop1')"> Acts 14:22</span>).&nbsp;</p>

</div>
</div>
<!-- end bible --></div>
This is an important principle to teach as we make disciples. Paul and Barnabas completed their work and went back to their home church to report about what the Lord had done. The entire trip lasted about one year. Not too long after this trip, Paul wrote a letter back to the new churches in the province of Galatia.

<p class="up">The letter to the Galatian churches can be read here</a>.</p>
