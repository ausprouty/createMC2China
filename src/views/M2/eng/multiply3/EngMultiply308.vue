<h3>The Believers Share Their Possessions</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had.<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And God&rsquo;s grace was so powerfully at work in them all<sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>that there were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>and put it at the apostles&rsquo; feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means &ldquo;son of encouragement&rdquo;),<sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles&rsquo; feet.</p>

<h3>Ananias and Sapphira</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">5:1 </sup>Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>With his wife&rsquo;s full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself, but brought the rest and put it at the apostles&rsquo; feet.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Then Peter said, &ldquo;Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land?<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Didn&rsquo;t it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn&rsquo;t the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied just to human beings but to God.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened.<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Then some young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Peter asked her, &ldquo;Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that is the price.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Peter said to her, &ldquo;How could you conspire to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband.<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events.</p>

<p class="up">The believers had a loving community. They boldly shared their faith and made sacrifices to care for one another. We see how one man from Cyprus, Joseph called Barnabas, generously sold some land he owned to help meet the needs of others in the church. But we also see how one couple tried to deceive the church. Their motive was not to help the poor, but to increase their reputation as being generous and spiritual among the believers. The Lord intervened and the hypocrisy of Ananias and Sapphira was not allowed to spread. We learn that lying to the Holy Spirit is the same as lying to God, which makes the Holy Spirit equal with God (<span class="popup-link" @click = "popUp('pop1')"> Acts 5:3-4</span>).&nbsp;</p>

<div class="popup invisible" id="pop1"><!-- begin bible -->

<p><sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Then Peter said, &ldquo;Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land?<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Didn&rsquo;t it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn&rsquo;t the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied just to human beings but to God.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<!-- end bible --></div>
Even though we have the privilege of a personal relationship with a holy God through Jesus, this unique incident of God&rsquo;s judgement reminded the believers to have proper respect for the Lord. As we pursue the Lord&rsquo;s heart for the needs of others, we need to do it with integrity.
