<p>We learned about Pharisees in the first story of hope. They were the religious leaders. They were very careful to avoid non-religious people. The tax collectors were not respected by Pharisees. They were often corrupt and took bribes from people rather than collecting the proper tax. Jesus told a story of a Pharisee and a tax collector who were worshipping God. They prayed to God very differently.</p>

<h3>The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable:<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: &lsquo;God, I thank you that I am not like other people&mdash;robbers, evildoers, adulterers&mdash;or even like this tax collector.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, &lsquo;God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>The Little Children and Jesus</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>But Jesus called the children to him and said, &ldquo;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Pharisee was condemned by Jesus because his attitude was not humble and repentant. The tax collector was approved by Jesus because of his humble attitude. Jesus says that even a non-religious person like the tax collector can be justified before God through a humble attitude. We must recognize that we are sinful people and humble ourselves before God like the tax collector.</p>
