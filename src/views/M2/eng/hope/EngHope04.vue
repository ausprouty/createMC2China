<h3>The Parable of the Unmerciful Servant</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, &ldquo;Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered, &ldquo;I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;At this the servant fell on his knees before him. &lsquo;Be patient with me,&rsquo; he begged, &lsquo;and I will pay back everything.&rsquo;<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>The servant&rsquo;s master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him and began to choke him. &lsquo;Pay back what you owe me!&rsquo; he demanded.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, &lsquo;Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt.<sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>When the other servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Then the master called the servant in. &lsquo;You wicked servant,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>Shouldn&rsquo;t you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?&rsquo;<sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Forgiving others is a very important part of following Jesus. Jesus helps Peter learn that God wants us to continually forgive others because we have experienced God&rsquo;s forgiveness. Since we are forgiven, we must also forgive others. We do not count how many times we are mistreated. We forgive rather than count sins against us. We can do this because we have been forgiven by God for our many sins.</p>
