<h3>Jesus Before Pilate and Herod</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">66&nbsp;</sup>At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and the teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them.<sup class="versenum">67&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;If you are the Messiah,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;tell us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jesus answered, &ldquo;If I tell you, you will not believe me,<sup class="versenum">68&nbsp;</sup>and if I asked you, you would not answer.<sup class="versenum">69&nbsp;</sup>But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">70&nbsp;</sup>They all asked, &ldquo;Are you then the Son of God?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He replied, &ldquo;You say that I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">71&nbsp;</sup>Then they said, &ldquo;Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">23:1 </sup>Then the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>And they began to accuse him, saying, &ldquo;We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Messiah, a king.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>So Pilate asked Jesus, &ldquo;Are you the king of the Jews?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have said so,&rdquo; Jesus replied.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, &ldquo;I find no basis for a charge against this man.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>But they insisted, &ldquo;He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>When he learned that Jesus was under Herod&rsquo;s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform a sign of some sort.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him.<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>That day Herod and Pilate became friends&mdash;before this they had been enemies.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people,<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>and said to them, &ldquo;You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Therefore, I will punish him and then release him.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">[17]&nbsp;</sup></p>

<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>But the whole crowd shouted, &ldquo;Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>(Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>But they kept shouting, &ldquo;Crucify him! Crucify him!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>For the third time he spoke to them: &ldquo;Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>So Pilate decided to grant their demand.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will.</p>

<p>Pilate recognized that Jesus was not guilty and should not die. He tried to release Jesus but the people rejected Jesus&rsquo; release. They preferred to release the man Barabbas who had murdered others.</p>

<p>Jesus put his hope in God his Father rather than in Pilate or the crowds of people. His hope gave him confidence to face his own death through crucifixion.</p>

<p>We can have hope that frees us from fear of others and even from fear of death.</p>
