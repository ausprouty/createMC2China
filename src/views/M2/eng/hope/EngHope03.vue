<p>Zacchaeus was a dishonest man whose curiosity led him to Jesus Christ. His name means &quot;pure one&quot; or &quot;innocent&quot; in Hebrew. He was a short man. He wanted to see Jesus. Zacchaeus had to climb a tree to catch a glimpse of Jesus passing by.</p>

<h3>Zacchaeus the Tax Collector</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>He wanted to see who Jesus was, but because he was short he could not see over the crowd.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, &ldquo;Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>All the people saw this and began to mutter, &ldquo;He has gone to be the guest of a sinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, &ldquo;Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zacchaeus was curious about Jesus. He wanted to learn more. Jesus accepted him and went to his house to eat and to talk. Zacchaeus hoped to be a different person. This hope and his trust in Jesus made changes in his life. He returned money from those he had corruptly mistreated. He showed the evidences of a changed life.</p>
